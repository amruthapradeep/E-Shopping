<p align="center"> <font size="18" color="maroon"> Fashion means something that is trendy or valued in a certain time period. The prevailing fashion/ trends/style is called ‘vogue’. Fashion can also simply mean our lifestyle: the clothing and accessories that we wear and the cosmetics that we apply. Besides clothing, ornaments, accessories, and make up, it also includes our mannerism and behavior. </font> </p>
